### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and
some CSS as well.  A little extra HTML/CSS research will be required
as indicated in the directions.


1. **5 points** HTML Challenge: Modify `rps.html` so that the browser renders
   the page as closely as possible to [rps-target.png](rps-target.png), which is
   a shortened version of the Wikipedia article on the game ["Rock, Paper, Scissors"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).

   HINT: No CSS coding is required.

2. **5 points** CSS Challenge: Modify `resume.html`
   so that it looks like [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

   Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact
   requirements.  Note that the entire content
   of the page should be a width of 960px, and that
   the page should be centered on your screen.

   HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS,
   as well as how the `margin` property can be used to center
   the entire page on the screen.

   ANOTHER HINT: You only need to add CSS code inside the `<style>...</style>` element.
   No other HTML changes should be necessary.
