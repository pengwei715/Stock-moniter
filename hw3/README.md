### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice at manipulating the DOM
with JavaScript.

Watch the instructional video here: https://youtu.be/3-R_hM5eVO8

You will need to become familiar with:

* [HTML Entities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity)
* [The `<select>` Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)
* [Element methods and navigating the DOM tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)
* Possibly more

### Part 1. Marking Favorite Stations

Start by opening the [bikes.html](bikes.html) page.

NOTE: You will earn 1 point if you solve this part without modifying any existing HTML code.

  * Allow the user to click the heart icon next to a station name to
    add it to their list of favorites.
    * (2 points) The heart should become a filled-in heart (HTML entity `&#9829;`)
    * (3 points) The station name should be added to the list of Favorites

  * Allow the user to click the filled-in heart of a station name
    to remove it from their list of favorites.
    * (2 points) The heart should become an outlined heart (HTML entity `&#9825;`)
    * (3 points) The station name should be removed from the list of Favorites


  * HINT: Test carefully. Make sure you can toggle the favorite status on and off many   times, not just the first time!

### Part 2. Filtering The Station List by Area

You will need to add new HTML code in order to solve this exercise.

  * Allow the user to select a filter:
    * (1 point) "All" should show all of the stations
    * (1 point) "University of Chicago" should show only stations near campus
    * (1 point) "Loop" should show only stations near the Loop
    * (1 point) "North Side" should show only stations on the north side



  * HINT: Read the HTML source code to find the CSS classes that indicate
    which stations belong to which area.
