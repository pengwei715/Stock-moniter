### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with page layout and
mobile design.  Some HTML and CSS research will be required.


**1. Large Layout**.

Take a look at the "above the fold" screenshot I took of the [Etsy home page](etsy-target.png).

  * Think about how you would begin to build this page yourself.
    * Can you organize the design into a series of rows?
    * Within each row, can you identify the columns?
  * Refer to the [etsy-specifications](etsy-specifications.png) to make
    sure you do not try to implement the text-on-image technique.
  * Modify [the starter page](etsy.html) so that it looks as like [the target](etsy-target.png).
  * You can add as many other files as needed (for example, you should add a CSS file instead
    of using a `<style>` element in the HTML itself).
  * You are encouraged to learn additional CSS techniques not covered in class
    but you may NOT use a full CSS framework such as Boostrap or Foundation.
  * It will NOT be possible to build an exact replica.  You can use
    the "system font" instead.  Use this tutorial: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/
  * You are encouraged to study and/or steal from  the live https://www.etsy.com/ to determine margins,
    colors, the orange checkmarks, and anything else that you would find helpful
    (assuming their home page hasn't changed drastically by the time
    you work on this assignment).
  * Because the live site may have changed by the time you work on this
    assignment, I saved two images called etsy2.jpg and etsy3.jpg
    for you to use.

**2. Mobile Layout**

Next, the page should respond appropriately to mobile devices: [etsy_mobile.png](etsy-mobile-target.png)
The target is a screenshot of the iPhone X simulator inside the Chrome Inspector, but
it should be about the same for any mobile phone.


**Grading Rubric**

* 7 points: Large layout closely resembles the target
* 4 points: Mobile layout closely resembles the target
* 2 points: Reasonable choice of typography (use the "system font" trick mentioned above
  or pick your own fonts) & reasonable match of font weights/color schemes
* 2 points: Fine details: rounded corners as needed, icons in toolbar,
            nice search form with seamless "Search" button,
            orange custom checkmarks, search placeholder text ("Search for items or shops")
